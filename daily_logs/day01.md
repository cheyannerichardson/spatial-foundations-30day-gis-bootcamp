### Day 1 – February 25, 2026
**Focus:** QGIS Introduction + Symbology Basics (Modules 1, 2.1–2.4.13)

**What I learned:**  
- QGIS interface basics: Map Canvas for viewing layers, Layers panel for managing data (vector: points/lines/polygons), toolbars for zoom/pan, and Status Bar for scale/coordinates.  
- Symbology fundamentals: Visual styling of layers using colors, stroke width, fills; difference between map layers (data) and symbol layers (appearance). 
- Single symbol editing: Change fill/stroke for polygons, markers for points, lines for roads (e.g., gray+yellow+black road lines).
- Symbol layers: Stack multiple layers (e.g., broad gray base + thin yellow + black outline); control order with Symbol Levels dialog.
- Scale-based visibility: Hide layers at wrong scales (e.g., continents at street level).
- Point/line/polygon symbol types: Simple Fill, Simple Marker; advanced like Arrow Line, Mask, Geometry Generator for centroids without new layers.[web:1][web:3]
