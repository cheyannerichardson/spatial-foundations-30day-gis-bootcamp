# Spatial Foundations: 30 Day GIS Bootcamp
I'm an **emerging GIS analyst and independent learner**, passionate about **urban design and historical restoration**, developing **technical spatial analysis and project-writing skills** for **climate-adaptive heritage preservation**.

I’m passionate about integrating **environmental resilience, cultural preservation, and community vitality** in planning and design. My work bridges **technical spatial analysis** with **hands‑on restoration** and **visionary urban strategies** to protect vulnerable environments while celebrating **place‑based heritage**.  

From **climate‑resilient coastal restoration** to **adaptive urban regeneration** rooted in traditional architectural principles, my projects explore how **data‑driven tools** and **design innovation** can shape sustainable, culturally grounded futures.  

Through continuous self‑directed learning—such as **QGIS** and **spatial data analysis** training—I aim to pair **technical proficiency with creative foresight** in advancing equitable and climate‑adaptive planning frameworks.

## Weekly Progress Log

### Week 1: QGIS Foundations
| Task | Status | Notes/Link |
|------|--------|------------|
| QGIS Training Manual Modules 1-3 (interface, data loading, symbology) |  | Coastal elevation + parcel data |
| Spatial Thoughts Course: Sections 1-2 (basics, vector data) |  | 0 hours total |
| **Project 1: Coastal Lighthouse Restoration** |  | SQL climate vulnerability analysis + Excel sea level projections. [View](projects/lighthouse-restoration/) |
| Hours | 0/15 | Daily: Interface (D1-3), coastal queries (D4-5), project start (D6-7) |

**Key Output:** GIS vulnerability assessment for historic lighthouse preservation integrating climate resilience strategies.

### Week 2: Spatial Analysis Essentials
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Manual Modules 4-6 (vector/raster: buffer, clip, overlay) |  | Seawall buffer + ecological analysis |
| Spatial Thoughts: Sections 3-4 (raster, analysis tools) |  | 0 hours |
| Excel integration: Trail connectivity metrics |  | Power Query processed pedestrian flow data |
| **Project 2: Stanley Park Seawall Redevelopment** |  | Multi-functional trail network analysis. [View](projects/stanley-seawall/) |
| Hours | 0/15 | Network analysis plugins |

**Key Output:** Climate-adaptive seawall design with enhanced pedestrian connectivity and ecological resilience mapping.

### Week 3: Advanced Urban GIS + Python
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Manual Modules 7-9 (heatmaps, network analysis) |  | Hanok courtyard spatial modeling |
| Spatial Thoughts: Sections 5-6 (advanced analysis, Python) |  | GeoPandas hanok pattern automation |
| **Project 3: Hanok Urban Regeneration** |  | Courtyard ventilation + daylight analysis. [View](projects/hanok-regeneration/) |
| Hours | 0/15 | Python automation + video demo |

**Key Output:** Traditional hanok spatial principles adapted for high-density urban ventilation and community analysis.

### Week 4: Professional Project Finalization
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Project documentation & README polish |  | Professional write-ups for all 3 projects |
| High-res map exports + project visuals |  | Print-ready cartographic layouts |
| QGIS2Web interactive maps deployment |  | Individual project web maps live |
| **Professional Project Proposals** |  | 3 client-ready GIS proposals generated. [View](projects/proposals/) |
| Hours | 0/15 | Proposal formatting + final QA |

**Key Output:** Three publication-ready GIS projects with accompanying professional proposals positioning each as standalone client deliverables for heritage planning and urban resilience consultancies.

## Projects Showcase
1. **[Coastal Lighthouse Restoration](projects/lighthouse-restoration/)**: Climate resilience strategies for historic preservation
2. **[Stanley Park Seawall Redevelopment](projects/stanley-seawall/)**: Multi-functional climate-adaptive waterfront trail
3. **[Hanok Urban Regeneration](projects/hanok-regeneration/)**: Traditional spatial systems for modern high-density housing

## Next Steps
- Esri Technical Certification
- **Volunteer GIS mapping for St. Augustine Lighthouse** 
- Publish projects as ArcGIS StoryMaps for portfolio visibility
- Expand Hanok project with AutoCAD/Revit for architectural heritage documentation

## Bootcamp Summary
Transformed SQL/Excel expertise into production-ready GIS skills through 60 hours of intensive QGIS training and 3 publication-ready projects:

- 🏛️ **Heritage Preservation** - Coastal lighthouse restoration analysis
- 🌊 **Waterfront Adaptation** - Stanley Park seawall redevelopment  
- 🏠 **Urban Regeneration** - Hanok architectural spatial modeling

Portfolio demonstrates professional-grade spatial analysis for heritage planning and urban resilience consultancies. Ready for junior GIS tech roles.
